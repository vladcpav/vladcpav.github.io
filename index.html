            <h1>Hi, my name is Vlad-Constantin Pavel </h1>
            <p>I started studying Computer Science in college where in the first instance I was taught how to code in visual studio.  I was introduced to the Java coding experience for the first time here, at City. In less than a year of studying I managed to build a 2D based platform game.
              The game is pretty simple, just like Joyride Jetpack, which was my inspiration. You have to move the character using WASD, destroy enemies, collect ammo and pass to the next level.
              The character can jump using the W key, move around using A and D key and shoot using the Space key. Make sure you do not let the enemies shoot you because your health will go lower and lower until the character dies, which means that you failed the level. I am glad I managed to make this game work considering I did not have much of a programming background experience when I started working on the first Milestone.</p>
